      institution: Apple GPU
      year: 2023
      month: April - September
      description: Using SystemVerilog and UVM, I worked as part of a small team working on verification of a high performance interconnect network.
                   - Designed stimulus 
                   - Improved testbenches
                   - Improved performance of testbenches
                   - Developed models based upon architectural specification
                   - Debugged failures using logs and waveform viewers
                   - Developed scripts to automate tasks
                   - Developed verification tools to aid in debugging
    - title: Logical Design Intern 
      institution: Graphcore
      year: 2022
      month: June - September
      description:
        - title: Design, verification, and build of multiple modules in SystemVerilog with the use of C++ and Python for infrastructure.
          contents:
            - Used SystemVerilog and EDA tools to design, synthesize and verify different Floating Point arithmetic unit hardware modules.
            - Developed these designs using various optimization techniques in order to meet tight requirements by analyzing timing and area reports.
            - Optimised designs using physical synthesis tools.
            - Created custom testbenches to verify the designs using SystemVerilog.

    - title: Hardware-based mixed-format arithmetic accelerator 
      year: 2023
      description: Designed an arithmetic accelerator deployed on an FPGA to accelerate computations written in C.
                   This was an exploratory project in which the designs were iterated and optimised for timing and area.
                   The final design incorporated DMA accesses and a custom hardware block including a CORDIC implementation.
    - title: ProPutter
      year: 2023
      description: Built an embedded system deployed on a microprocessor which, when mounted on a golf putter, would take measurements
                   of the user's putt, and provide feedback on the user's performance via a web-app. This project involved optimising the
                   design for latency and memory usage.
    - title: Synth-Starter
      year: 2022
      description: Built an embedded system deployed on a real-time operating system, which collated information from multiple nodes in a wired network and
                   distributed commands to enable the nodes to play music in sync. This project involved developing custom protocols for communication
                   between nodes and optimising said protocols for latency and bandwidth. I explored thread-safe design practices and how to manage
                   a distributed system with hardware constraints.
    - title: Mars Rover
      year: 2022
      description: Designed an image processing accelerator to be deployed on an FPGA. This included hardware 
          implementations of filtering, color space conversions and gradient detection.
    - title: Custom multi-core CPU
      year: 2021
      description: Designed a custom pipelined dual core CPU with arbitration logic and floating point capabilities. 
                   This project involved designing a custom ISA and Pipeline. I explored the design of a pipelined CPU, 
                   and the challenges of designing a CPU with multiple cores.
