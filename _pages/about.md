Hello! I'm Bardia. I am a 3rd year Electronic and Information Engineering student at Imperial College London. I believe that the world of hardware engineering and computer architecture is fascinating. To that end, I am pursuing a career in the field. Currently, I am undergoing a 6 month industrial placement at Apple GPU, working with the Design Verification team. The experience has and is developing my understanding of ASIC development greatly, and I am gaining a sincere appreciation of the value that design verification brings to chip development.
